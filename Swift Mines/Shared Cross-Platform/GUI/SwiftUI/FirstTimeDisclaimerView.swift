                This was written entirely in Swift, using the new SwiftUI platform! Since SwiftUI is in its early stages, it has a few odd quirks. One that you'll notice is that it does not yet support right-clicking. For now, you can hold Control and click, or perform a long-click, to place a flag. Once SwiftUI supports right-clicking, this game will be update to include that.
